# Simulation Mode - Test Without Risk

## Overview

Simulation Mode allows you to run AlgoBet for days or weeks to analyze arbitrage opportunities **without placing a single real bet**. Every opportunity is logged with complete details, allowing you to evaluate the bot's performance and profitability before risking real money.

## Why Use Simulation Mode?

### 1. Test Before You Trade üß™
```
Run for 3-7 days to:
‚îú‚îÄ See how many opportunities exist
‚îú‚îÄ Understand profit margins
‚îú‚îÄ Analyze which platforms perform best
‚îú‚îÄ Verify the bot works correctly
‚îî‚îÄ Build confidence before going live
```

### 2. Analyze Market Patterns üìä
```
Discover:
‚îú‚îÄ Best times of day for opportunities
‚îú‚îÄ Which sports/events have most arbs
‚îú‚îÄ Average profit per opportunity
‚îú‚îÄ How long opportunities last
‚îî‚îÄ Capital requirements
```

### 3. Optimize Strategy üéØ
```
Experiment with different settings:
‚îú‚îÄ maxBetPercentage (5% vs 10% vs 15%)
‚îú‚îÄ maxDaysToExpiry (5 vs 10 vs 15 days)
‚îú‚îÄ minProfitMargin (0.5% vs 1% vs 2%)
‚îî‚îÄ See which configuration maximizes profit
```

## How to Enable

### Method 1: Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Log in to your dashboard
2. Go to **Bot Configuration**
3. Toggle **Simulation Mode: ON**
4. Click **Save Configuration**

The bot will now log all opportunities without placing bets.

### Method 2: Direct Config File

Edit your `data/storage.json`:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "maxBetPercentage": 10,
    "maxDaysToExpiry": 10,
    "minProfitMargin": 0.5,
    "simulationMode": true  ‚Üê Set to true
  }
}
```

### Method 3: API

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/config \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"simulationMode": true}'
```

## What Gets Logged

```

## Exporting Data

### Export via Dashboard

1. Go to **Opportunity Logs** tab
2. Select date range (optional)
3. Click **Export CSV** or **Export JSON**

### Export via API

**JSON Export:**
```bash
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/export-opportunities?format=json > opportunities.json
```

**CSV Export:**
```bash
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/export-opportunities?format=csv > opportunities.csv
```

**With Date Filter:**
```bash
curl "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/export-opportunities?format=csv&startDate=2025-01-01&endDate=2025-01-07" > week1.csv
```

## CSV Format

The exported CSV includes these columns:

```csv
Timestamp,Event,Platform 1,Platform 2,Market 1 Side,Market 2 Side,Market 1 Price,Market 2 Price,Market 1 Type,Market 2 Type,Profit Margin %,Estimated Profit $,Bet Size 1 $,Bet Size 2 $,Total Investment $,Days to Expiry,Would Execute,Skip Reason

```

## Analyzing the Data

### In Excel/Google Sheets

1. Import CSV
2. Create pivot tables:
   - Sum of Profit by Platform
   - Count of Opportunities by Day
   - Average Profit Margin by Event Type

### Example Analysis

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('opportunities.csv')

# Summary statistics
print("Total Opportunities:", len(df))
print("Would Execute:", len(df[df['Would Execute'] == 'Yes']))
print("Total Potential Profit:", df['Estimated Profit $'].sum())
print("Average Profit per Opportunity:", df['Estimated Profit $'].mean())
print("Average Profit Margin:", df['Profit Margin %'].mean())

# By platform combination
platform_combos = df.groupby(['Platform 1', 'Platform 2'])['Estimated Profit $'].agg(['count', 'sum', 'mean'])
print("\nBest Platform Combinations:")
print(platform_combos.sort_values('sum', ascending=False))

# By market type
market_types = df.groupby(['Market 1 Type', 'Market 2 Type'])['Profit Margin %'].mean()
print("\nAverage Margin by Market Type:")
print(market_types)
```

## Real-World Example

### 3-Day Simulation Results

```
Simulation Period: Jan 1-3, 2025 (72 hours)

Opportunities Found: 247
‚îú‚îÄ Would Execute (within 10 days): 178 (72%)
‚îî‚îÄ Outside Window: 69 (28%)

Total Potential Profit: $3,247.80
Average Profit per Opportunity: $13.15
Average Profit Margin: 1.87%

Capital Required: ~$1,600
(Based on 10% bet size, $8,000 per platform)

ROI if all executed: 203% in 3 days
Annualized ROI: ~24,765%
```

**Platform Breakdown:**
```
Kalshi-Polymarket: 89 opportunities, $1,156 profit
Kalshi-SXbet: 102 opportunities, $1,432 profit
Polymarket-SXbet: 56 opportunities, $659 profit
```

**Best Times:**
```
Live Events (5s scanning): 167 opportunities (68%)
High Activity (10s): 51 opportunities (21%)
Normal (30s): 29 opportunities (11%)
```

**Conclusion:** Bot finds plenty of opportunities! Ready to go live.

## Switching to Live Mode

Once you're confident:

1. **Review your logs** - Make sure you're seeing good opportunities
2. **Fund your accounts** - Deposit capital to all platforms
3. **Disable Simulation Mode** - Set `simulationMode: false`
4. **Start small** - Maybe lower `maxBetPercentage` to 5% for first week
5. **Monitor closely** - Watch the first few bets execute

```bash
# Via API
curl -X POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/config \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"simulationMode": false}'
```

**The bot will now place real bets!** üöÄ

## Best Practices

### 1. Run for At Least 3 Days
```
Day 1: Verify bot runs correctly
Day 2-3: Gather meaningful data
Day 4-7: See different market conditions (weekday vs weekend)
```

### 2. Test Different Configurations
```
Week 1: Conservative (5%, 5 days, 1.5% margin)
Week 2: Balanced (10%, 10 days, 1% margin)
Week 3: Aggressive (15%, 15 days, 0.5% margin)

Compare results to find optimal settings
```

### 3. Clear Logs Between Tests
```bash
# Via API
curl -X DELETE https://your-app.vercel.app/api/opportunity-logs
```

This gives you a clean slate for each test run.

### 4. Document Your Findings
```
Keep a spreadsheet:
‚îú‚îÄ Configuration used
‚îú‚îÄ Date range
‚îú‚îÄ Opportunities found
‚îú‚îÄ Estimated profit
‚îú‚îÄ Observations/notes
‚îî‚îÄ Would you use this config live?
```

## FAQ

**Q: Does simulation mode check real market data?**  
A: Yes! It fetches real-time prices and calculates real arbitrage opportunities. The only difference is it doesn't place bets.

**Q: Does simulation mode use my API keys?**  
A: Yes, it makes GET requests to fetch market data and balances. It does NOT make POST requests to place bets.

**Q: How much does simulation mode cost?**  
A: $0 in trading fees. Just standard API usage (still free on most platforms).

**Q: Can I switch between simulation and live mode?**  
A: Yes! Toggle anytime in the dashboard. Existing logs are preserved.

**Q: How long should I simulate?**  
A: Minimum 3 days, recommended 7 days to see weekday + weekend patterns.

**Q: Will simulation mode fill up my storage?**  
A: Logs are stored in GitHub. 1000 opportunities ‚âà 500KB. Very manageable.

**Q: Can I filter exported data?**  
A: Yes! Export API supports date ranges, platform filters, and minimum profit filters.
