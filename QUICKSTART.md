## How It Works

### Arbitrage Example

**Scenario**: NBA game - Knicks vs Lakers

**Kalshi**:
- Knicks to win: 72Â¢ (0.7% fee = 72.5Â¢ total)

**Polymarket**:
- Knicks to lose: 27Â¢ (2% fee = 27.5Â¢ total)

**Total Cost**: 72.5Â¢ + 27.5Â¢ = 100Â¢ = **$1.00** (Break even, no arbitrage)

**But if**:
- Knicks to win: 70Â¢ (70.49Â¢ with fee)
- Knicks to lose: 28Â¢ (28.56Â¢ with fee)
- **Total: 99.05Â¢ = Profit of 0.95Â¢ per dollar!**

### Bot Actions

1. **Scans** both platforms every 30 seconds
2. **Matches** markets by title
3. **Calculates** profit after fees
4. **Validates** opportunity is still good
5. **Sizes** bets (max 4% of each account)
6. **Places** both bets simultaneously (Fill-or-Kill)
7. **Records** the arbitrage group
8. **Monitors** until resolution

### Risk Management

- **Zero Risk**: Win regardless of outcome
- **No Position Closing**: Let markets resolve naturally
- **Fee Aware**: Accounts for all trading fees
- **Balance Limits**: Never over-expose accounts
- **Time Limits**: Only short-term markets (< 5 days)

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Daily
- [ ] Check dashboard in morning
- [ ] Verify bot is running
- [ ] Review any new bets

### Weekly
- [ ] Export and analyze data
- [ ] Rebalance account funds if needed
- [ ] Adjust parameters based on results

### Monthly
- [ ] Rotate API keys
- [ ] Review profitability
- [ ] Optimize configuration

## Common Issues

### No Opportunities Found

**Cause**: Markets don't have favorable odds or don't overlap

**Solutions**:
- Lower `MIN_PROFIT_MARGIN` to 0.5%
- Increase `MAX_DAYS_TO_EXPIRY` to 7
- Wait for more volatile markets
- Check both platforms have active markets

### Bets Not Placing

**Cause**: Insufficient balance or API issues

**Solutions**:
- Check account balances on both platforms
- Verify API keys have trading permissions
- Test APIs: `npm run test-apis`
- Review Vercel/console logs for errors

### Bot Stops Running

**Cause**: Vercel serverless timeout or error

**Solutions**:
- Use Vercel Cron (automatic with `vercel.json`)
- Or use external cron (cron-job.org) pinging `/api/bot/cron`
- Check logs for errors: `vercel logs --follow`

## Tips for Success

### Start Conservative
- Begin with 1-2% max bet size
- Use small account balances ($100-200 each)
- Monitor closely for first week

### Gradually Increase
- After successful week, increase to 3%
- After successful month, increase to 4%
- Gradually increase account balances

### Optimize Over Time
- Track which markets are most profitable
- Adjust time windows based on data
- Fine-tune profit margin thresholds

### Stay Informed
- Follow market news
- Understand what you're betting on
- Be aware of market trends
